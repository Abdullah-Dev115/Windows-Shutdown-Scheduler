# Windows Shutdown Scheduler

Hello, I'm Abdullah!

This is the first project I share, which Windows Shutdown Scheduler.
I used Python to develop this program. I used Tkinter library for the GUI. Also used (os) library and (webbrowser) library
and (pyinstaller) to turn the program into exe file.

pretty simple project! If you open the program, you need to choose one of the three button or units "Hours,Minutes,Seconds"
then enter the number of hours or minutes or seconds to schedule the shutdown time then, click the "Shutdown" button
and schedule the shutdown time!

In this program there is simple error handling conditons. For example, If the user does not enter a number and clicked
"Shutdown" button
![Empty Error](https://github.com/Abo0od-Dev115/WinShut-Scheduler/assets/146442014/eec12883-0c9f-4336-90fe-51645aec987d)

or if the user already set a shutdown command and tried to set another one
![Set command](https://github.com/Abo0od-Dev115/WinShut-Scheduler/assets/146442014/bf383145-0b8e-47fb-a556-c241118178ad)

Also ValueError handling.

I'm still beginner programmer willing to learn more and create more projects! and waiting your advices and suggestions
and your feedback, that's will help me a lot to improve my skills and future projects!
